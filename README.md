# Pick the Right Ranger Color Game ðŸŽ®

## Introduction
The **Pick the Right Ranger Color Game** is an interactive Python game inspired by the Power Rangers Dino Thunder theme. In this color-matching challenge, you compete against the computer by selecting a Ranger color and trying to match it with the computer's randomly chosen color.

## How It Works
1. **User Selection**: You select a Ranger color by choosing a number from 1 to 5:
   - 1: Red Ranger
   - 2: Blue Ranger
   - 3: Yellow Ranger
   - 4: Black Ranger
   - 5: White Ranger

2. **Computer Selection**: The computer randomly selects a Ranger color.

3. **Winning Condition**: If your selected color matches the computer's color, you win the round and receive 1 point. If not, the computer receives 1 point.

4. **Continue or Exit**: After each round, the game prompts you to continue playing or to stop. If you choose to stop, the final score is displayed.

## Features
- User input validation for Ranger color selection.
- Randomized computer choice using Python's `random` library.
- Looping gameplay until the user decides to exit.

## Technologies Used
- Python programming language
- Basic programming concepts including loops, conditionals, and random number generation.

## How to Run
1. Make sure you have Python installed on your machine.
2. Clone the repository or download the project files.
3. Open the Jupyter Notebook (`P01_Pick_the_Right_Ranger_Colour_Game.ipynb`) in Google Colab or any local Jupyter environment.
4. Run the notebook cells to start playing the game!
